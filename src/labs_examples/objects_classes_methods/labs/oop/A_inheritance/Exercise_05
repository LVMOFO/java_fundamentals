Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?
In the class below only constructors are utilized; in this case the Parent constructor is called automatically so
you get both:
Parent called
Child called


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
